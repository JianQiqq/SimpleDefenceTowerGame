# SimpleDefenceTowerGame
This is a defence tower game project made by unity3d version 5.5 using C#.
There is no much differences between the project on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0">youbute tutorial Brackeys</a>  and my project. However, I made some changes.
